### Recovery Retrospective

**What went well:**
- All quality gates restored (build, test, lint, typecheck)
- Critical security fix landed (fileService.ts path traversal)
- v0.15.0 shipped with Tower Defense genre mode
- Clean git hygiene throughout

**Deferred items carried forward:**
- Export flow end-to-end browser validation → M9
- AI Command apply/reject smoke test → M9 (AI→runtime disconnect is a strategic gap)
- These are tracked in `docs/sprints/follow_up_sprints.md` under M9 deliverables
